//! Fuse passthrough file system, mirroring an existing FS hierarchy.
//!
//! This file system mirrors the existing file system hierarchy of the system, starting at the
//! root file system. This is implemented by just "passing through" all requests to the
//! corresponding underlying file system.
//!
//! The code is derived from the
//! [CrosVM](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/) project,
//! with heavy modification/enhancements from Alibaba Cloud OS team.
